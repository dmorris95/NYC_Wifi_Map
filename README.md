Welcome to the NYC Wifi Hotspot map. This application uses Folium and Pandas to create an interactive map for users to view a specific borough's wifi hotspots. An example for the hotspots in Brooklyn is included in the repository.

Wifi Hotspot locations were retrieved from the NYC OpenData website: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/NYC-Wi-Fi-Hotspot-Locations/yjub-udmw/about_data
